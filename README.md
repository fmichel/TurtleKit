================================================

What is TurtleKit
-----------------

TurtleKit is an open source library for simulating artificial life models based on the Logo programming language.
TurtleKit is not an IDE but provides a flexible API that allows to freely extend the platform default possibilities.
TurtleKit is built on top of the MaDKit library and thus benefits from all the multi-agent programming possibilities provided by this library.
